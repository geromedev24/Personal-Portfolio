                Over the past couple of years, I have worked as someone who
                sells ideas to people who needs help in getting things done more
                efficiently. I always tell my daughters that I sell other
                parents something that would make their jobs easier so they can
                have more time to spend with their kids.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, after more than 10 years of working as a sales person, I
                find myself fascinated about how ideas can be turned into a
                website that is visually pleasing and at the same time fully
                functional and attracts user interaction.
              </p>

                During my free time, I have spent hours studying and creating
                websites and applications that I believe could be useful to my
                prospects and future clients.
